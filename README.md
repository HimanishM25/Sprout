### General Info:
A cross-platform mobile app designed primarily with Flutter and Dart.

---

### Main Vision:
In 2020, 67 percent of newbie gardeners said the epidemic encouraged their decision to start growing their own organic food.
Many of these people have no idea what plants to raise, how often they should indeed be watered, or what maladies they could develop and how to address them.
Our solution is a cross-platform application that helps rookie gardeners care for their plants appropriately.
